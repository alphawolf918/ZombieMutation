== Changelog ==

-v0.3-
* Added Nails.
    * Can be obtained by crafting 2 Iron Ingots.
* Added in Nail Groups.
    * Crafted using 4 Nails.
* Added Woodboxes.
    * Crafted using three Wooden Planks.
* Added in Metal Parts.
    * Crafted using Woodbox and Nail Group.
    * Currently unused.
* Added the Seeker mutation.
    * Baby Zombies can mutate into blue, tiny, grotesque versions of their previous selves, with a giant,
      bloody hole through their chests. They also develop a second head.
    * Seekers move extra fast, have a much higher chance to multiply, and follow the Player for a
      wider range. However, they do not hit very hard and have little health, making them much
      easier to kill. The trick is to kill them before they multiply into too many of themselves.
        * Seekers are the only Mutant to spawn copies of themselves instead of regular Zombies.
    * Seekers can also survive during the day and are immune to fire (and, by association, lava).
* Added in Barrier Blocks.
    * Completely invisible blocks that are unbreakable, similar to Bedrock, to be used in Adventure and RPG maps.
    * Prevents Players from leaving bounds, while still retaining the original look.
    * Only obtainable in Creative Mode (for very obvious reasons).


== KNOWN BUGS ==
* A mutation sound is supposed to play when a Zombie mutates, however for some reason it doesn't.
    * "Unable to play sound minecraft:none" (Related?)
    * Upon using the /playsound command, the sound plays despite it not working when called in the code (?)
    
--------

-v0.2-
* Added coins.
    * Currently completely useless by themselves.
* Added Medkits.
    * Crafted using alcohol and gauze.
        * Gauze can be obtained by crafting String and Paper.
        * Alcohol can be obtained by crafting a Glass Bottle, a Bucket of Water, Wheat Seeds, 
          and a Clay Ball.
    * Heals the Player for five hearts, which uses the Medkit.

== FIXES ==
* Mutants originally made copies of themselves when attacked. This was an accidental feature. 
  It should be fine now, but they do multiply sometimes. This can also be reduced if needed. They 
  now only spawn Zombies, which are then permitted to mutate freely.
* Mutants are not as strong and Zombies do not mutate as often.

--------

-v0.1-
* Zombies have a chance to mutate into different types of stronger zombies.
    * A Zombie must mutate into one, or a Villager must be killed by a Mutant to become one.
    * Mutants do not spawn on their own, however, a mutant may call in other Mutants as an aide.
    * Volatiles
        * Volatiles move faster, have more health, hit much harder and follow the player a longer range, 
      making for a smarter path-finding A.I.
            * They are slightly bigger than regular Zombies and have a different skin.
    * Overlords
        * Overlords move way faster, have a lot more health, hit the player incredibly hard, and follow the player for 
          much longer.
            * Much bigger than the Player (twice as big if not more).
            * Spider-like zombies that kill on-sight.
            * Much more likely for a Volatile to mutate into an Overlord than a Zombie to mutate into one.
* If a Player is killed by any form of Zombie (Mutant or otherwise), a Zombie version of that Player will spawn in their 
  place where they died.
    * This new Zombie will have a custom name tag that reads: "Zombie PlayerName"
    * Zombie Players can also morph into Mutants, and will retain their name-tags. The only difference is that
      the word "Zombie" will be replaced by the name of the Mutant in the name.

== KNOWN BUGS ==
* A mutation sound is supposed to play when a Zombie mutates, however for some reason it doesn't.
    * "Unable to play sound minecraft:none" (Related?)
* Mutants might be a little too strong at first and might mutate too quickly or move too fast, this can be nerfed if needed.
